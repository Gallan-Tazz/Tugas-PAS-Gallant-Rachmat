            <h2>THIS WAS A GREAT START TOWARDS ACHIEVING MY DREAM.</h2>
            <p>THIS IS IT, THIS IS MY HUMBLE LITTLE HOUSE, THE HOUSE THAT I BUILT, MY OWN PREACH TOWARDS LIFE ITSELF.
                I ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT THE BASIC NORM THAT HAS BEEN ACCUMULATED BY THE INHABITANTS OF THIS WORLD BACKFIRED HARD,
                THE BASIC NORM OR "KINDNESS" TOWARDS EACH OTHER HAS BEEN PULLING US BACK AS HUMANS FROM OUR OWN SELFISH DESIRE,
                STRAINING GOOD AND BAD IS AS EASIER THAN EVER BUT THERE IS NO BEAUTY FROM HAVING TWO THINGS THAT CO-SIDE WITH EACH OTHER
                YET HATING EACH OTHER DELIBERATELY.
            </p>
            
            <P>I DO BELIEVE THAT ART CHANGES THROUGH OUT THE YEARS AND THAT BOTHERS ME COMPLETELY, THE FIRST ART EVER IS A PAINTING
                PORTRAYING HUMANS AS CRUEL BEINGS THAT ARE BEYOND REDEMPTION, AND THAT IN ITSELF IS BEAUTIFUL, DEFINE BY OUR INSTINCTS
                AND LACK OF PATIENCE REALLY ADDS UP HOW WEAK AND MEEK WE ARE NOW, I'M HERE TO FIX THAT, BRINGING UP MY OWN SELF DESIRE OF
                KILLING HELPLESS LAMBS.

            <p>I'VE MADE THIS WEBSITE TO INFLUENCE PEOPLE TO JOIN THE REGIME AND BREAK THROUGH THE PARADIGMS WE CALLED "NORM"
                I'VE KILLED 60 PEOPLE IN A MINISCULE TIME I HAD BACK IN THE EARLY 70'S, I HAVE ACCUMULATED OVER 60 KILLS
                OVER THE 10 YEARS PERIOD, I'M HONESTLY APPALED WHEN I MET "HIM", THE ONE YOU SHOULD AVOID, VERGE, I WAS TOLD TO BUILD A HOUSE
                WITH LITTLE MATERIALS I HAVE AT MY DISPOSAL, BODIES... 60 OF THEM, MOST WERE ROTTEN BUT I USE A COUPLE OF WIRING TO MAKE IT WORK,
                IT'S HONESTLY BEAUTIFUL IN A WAY THAT IS HORRIFYING, TENDER YET SO EERY BUT NOW IT'S ETERNITY FOR ME AND PEACE FOR THEM.

                I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE AN ARCHITECTURE BUT MY MOM FORCED ME TO BE AN ENGINEER, I HATED IT, NOT TO BRAG BUT I KNOW THAT
                I'M A VERY PRISTINE AND SMART PERSON, I HAVE GOOD TASTE IN ART, I'M MORE INTELLECTUAL THAN ALL OF THESE SO CALLED
                "GENIUSES", I'M A WAY BETTER CANDIDATE TO REFORM THE WORLD BACK TO IT'S FORMER GLORY WHERE WE ALL JUST LIVE TO PASS THE DAY BY,
                NOBODY GETS IT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT SPECIAL LIKE ME.

                WHAT YOU SAW JUST NOW, IS WHAT I HAVE ACCUMULATED OVER THE YEARS THAT I'VE KILLED, 60 OF THEM TO BE SPECIFIC
                YOU'LL BE SURPRISED HOW EASY IT IS TO DO SUCH ART, THE TOOLS THAT WERE USED UPON THE CANVAS WERE NOT DIFFICULT TO APPLY TO THE CANAS ITSELF
                AND NOW THAT ALL OF THE CANVASES WERE ALL PAINTED BEAUTIFULLY, I COMBINED THEM ALL TOGETHER INTO ONE ART, "THE HOUSE".
            </p>

            <p>
                YOU MAY THINK THAT MY SENSE OF ART IS HUMOROUSLY DARK FOR THE SAKE OF BEING DARK WELL TO THAT I SAY
                Imagine a man walking down a street underneath the street lamps. Right under a lamp, is shadow is the densest but also the tiniest. Then, when he starts to move, his shadow grows in front of him. The shadow becomes bigger and bigger while it thins out. And the shadow behind him from the next lamp post emerges and becomes shorter and shorter until it reaches its ultimate density, as the man stands directly underneath the light. Let's say that the man standing underneath the first lamp post is me when I've just committed a murder. I feel strong and content. I start to walk, and the shadow in front of me grows bigger, like my pleasure. But at the same time, pain is on its way, represented by the shadow behind me from the next lamp post. And at the midpoint between the lamp posts, the pain is so great it outweighs my pleasure. And with every step forward, pleasure dissolves and pain intensifies behind me. Finally, the pain is so unbearably intense that I have to act. So when I reach the point with the next lamp in zenith, I will kill again.
